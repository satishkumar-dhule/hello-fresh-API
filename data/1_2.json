    "description": "If you can't go past the sweet soy combo, wait till you try it on roasted pumpkin! Sounds unusual, we know, but teamed with crisp veggies and a moreish plant-based aioli, you're in for a real treat.",
    "directions": "Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan-forced. Thickly slice the butternut pumpkin. Place on a lined oven tray. Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Roast for 15 minutes (it will finish roasting in step 4!).\nTIP: Peel the pumpkin, if preferred!\n\nWhile the pumpkin is roasting, finely chop the garlic. In a medium saucepan, heat some olive oil (1 tbs for 2 people / 2 tbs for 4 people) over a medium heat. Cook 1/2 the garlic until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Add the water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil. Add the jasmine rice. Stir, cover with a lid and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 12 minutes, then remove from the heat. Keep covered until the rice is tender and all the water is absorbed, 10-15 minutes.\nTIP: The rice will finish cooking in its own steam, so don't peek!\n\nWhile the rice is cooking, roughly chop the Asian greens. Trim the woody ends off the asparagus. Thinly slice the spring onion. In a small bowl, combine the Japanese dressing and plant-based aioli. Set aside.\nIn a second small bowl, combine the soy sauce and maple syrup. Drizzle over the roasted pumpkin, then sprinkle the mixed sesame seeds on top. Return the pumpkin to the oven to finish roasting, until golden and tender, 5-10 minutes.",
